<h1>
Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra
</h3>
<img src="https://st1.bgr.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/samsung-galaxy-note-10-plus-review.jpg##image/jpg" height="300px" width="600px" >
<p style="font-size: 25px;">The Samsung Galaxy Note series is dead. Well, not quite. Officially, the Galaxy Note line-up ended with the Samsung Galaxy Note20, which launched in 2020. However, it looks like Samsung is continuing the legacy of the ‘Note’ under the name of ‘Ultra’, which is their newest flagship in the Galaxy S-series.<br>

It features all of the characteristics of a Galaxy Note device – a big QHD+ display, fast performance, high-end cameras and of course, the built-in S-Pen. Did Samsung make the right decisions this time to earn the ‘Ultra’ name? Read on in my review to find out.<br>

Previously, the ‘Ultra’ variant of the smartphone shared a similar design with its smaller brothers. The S22 Ultra however is different from the S22 and the S22+. In fact, the S22 Ultra looks very much like the Note20 Ultra in many ways. Which is to say that the design of the S22 is very premium. The edges are curved in the front and back, and the railings are made out of metal, which feel great to hold in my hand. The rear panel is made out of glass, and it has the same beautiful frosted glass finish that does a pretty good job of hiding fingerprints. However, the metal railings have a glossy finish, and it immediately picked up fingerprints. Something that I was disappointed by was that the paint chipped near the hole for the S-Pen.
